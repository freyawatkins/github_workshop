# Workflows and projects

### What does your workflow currently look like?

### What do you organize for? 

### How do you do it? 

### Where do your files live?

---

# RStudio projects

### If your projects include R scripts, RMarkdown documents, HTML slides, etc., you should be using RStudio projects

--

- What are they?  

--

.content-box-blue[
`.rproj` files create an independent RStudio environment that limits the scope of your R session to the project in question.
]

--

- Why use them?  

--

  - They simplify organizing projects
  - They integrate well with github
  - They promote a project-oriented workflow

# Naming conventions

### Why?

- You probably don't spend much time thinking about how you name files and documents

- You should

- The idea is to follow a few simple guidelines that will make facilitate 
organizing your projects and make the file structure easily searchable

# Naming conventions

### How?

.pull-left[

- Use descriptive names 
  - .red[Bad]: `Experiment`
  - .green[Good]: `qualifying_paper_1`

- no capitals, no spaces (use `_` or `-`)
  - .red[Bad]: `Experiment for syntax class`
  - .green[Good]: `semantic_predictability_exp_1`

- no non-standard characters
  - .red[Bad]: `Analysis of ð for ICPhS 2019`
  - .green[Good]: `spirantization_icphs_2019`

# Tips and tricks

### Nested projects

- You can have RStudio projects inside of larger projects
- Only the larger project is a repo
- Ex.  
  - Project: `dissertation` (← repo)
  - Nested project: `production_semantic_processing_las`
  - Nested project: `prod_perc_bilabials_jphon`

--

### Alfred

- Productivity app 
- Only on Mac (I think), free
- Works like Spotlight search, but customizable
- Set to search for `.rproj` files
- Allows you to quickly open and close RStudio projects

# What gives?

.pull-left[
.big[
- In the programming world committing to master is a nono. Why?

- Most developers use git as version control for software

- The .blue[master branch] is usually left for public releases

- As such it should always work

# What's the solution?

### Branches

- Using branches gives us a way to work on different versions of a repository 
at one time

--

- By default a new repo has one branch called .large[.blue[master]] 

--

- Master is *the definitive* branch 

--

- We create new branches to experiment, make edits, create new features, etc., 
before committing them to master

--

- When you create a branch off of master you’re essentially making a copy, or 
snapshot of master at a specific point in time (like making a copy of 
a word file, i.e., `essay_final_version3_for_real.docx`)

--

- A branch should be used for making 'one logical change', usually to add a 
feature in software development

--

- If a collaborator makes changes to master while you are working on a branch, 
you can pull in those changes

# Yeah, but... academic writing is different

.big[
- Using branches in many cases may be overkill, depending on what your working 
on, i.e., slides for class
]

--

<p></p>

.big[
- But there are concrete examples where it makes sense to use branches...
  - when collaborating with others
  - when working on large projects
  - when making revisions to a manuscript
  - when making changes to your website, cv, conference presentation/poster
  - whenever breaking something small will have a large impact on the project
  - whenever the possibility of "going back" needs to be controlled and 
  easily achieved

--
- Working as collaborator: commit/push to master 

--
(.red[danger]!)

--
- Working as outside collaborator: fork, commit/push to remote,  
pull request to master
