.Large[

1. What is version control and why do I care?

2. Get familiar with Git/GitHub

???

get familiar with git/github
understand conceptually what it is, what it does, what it is for
learn how it can be a tool for our research (safety measures, promote open science)
open doors for collaboration

# What is version control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later

# Exercise II

### Cloning

.big[

1. Clone **my-repo** repo on to your computer  
(GitHub desktop: File > Clone repository)

2. Edit the README.md file using a text editor<br>and put some text in the body

3. Save everything, commit the changes to origin with<br>an informative message

4. Push changes from your local (cloned) repo to origin (the cloud)

5. Check github to see if it worked

]

---

# Exercise II - Review

### Key ideas

- We **clone** repositories from **origin** to our computers (**local** copies)

- We work like normal and **commit** changes

- When we finish we **push** changes from our local copy to origin

- The changes are then visible on GitHub

### Tips

- Always think carefully about where projects live 

- Practice this procedure (clone > edit > commit > push) with dummy repos to get the hang of it

- Don't be afraid to burn the house down

- Edit > commit > push

- We can send our modifications to the original repo via **pull requests**

### Tips

- Learn from other people by forking their projects üëç 

- It is extremely fulfilling to contribute to other people's projects üòä

- If you get stuck/make a mistake you can always burn the house down üî•

# Tips and tricks

### Nested projects

- You can have RStudio projects inside of larger projects
- Only the larger project is a repo
- Ex.  
  - Project: `dissertation` (‚Üê repo)
  - Nested project: `production_semantic_processing_las`
  - Nested project: `prod_perc_bilabials_jphon`

### Alfred

- Productivity app 
- Only on Mac (I think), free
- Works like Spotlight search, but customizable
- Set to search for `.rproj` files
- Allows you to quickly open and close RStudio projects

# Review

.big[
- There are different types of workflows when using github

<p></p>

.lightgrey[
- Standard way: 
    - Create repo 
    - Clone local copy 
    - Make changes 
    - Commit/push changes to remote
]

<p></p>

- When collaborating: 
    - Fork repo
    - Clone local copy
    - Make changes
    - Commit/push changes to remote
    - Submit pull request to origin

# What gives?

.pull-left[
.big[
- In the programming world committing to master is a nono. Why?

- Most developers use git as version control for software

- The .blue[master branch] is usually left for public releases

- As such it should always work

# What's the problem

.pull-left[
.big[
- You might break something

- You might get complicated merge conflicts
]

.full-width[.content-box-blue[
Person A is working on the same file as Person B, they both make changes 
and Person A tries to submit a pull request to master on a file that is 
different from when (s)he started

# What's the solution?

### Branches

- Using branches gives us a way to work on different versions of a repository 
at one time

--
count: false

- By default a new repo has one branch called .large[.blue[master]] 

--
count: false

- Master is *the definitive* branch 

--
count: false

- We create new branches to experiment, make edits, create new features, etc., 
before committing them to master

--
count: false

- When you create a branch off of master you‚Äôre essentially making a copy, or 
snapshot of master at a specific point in time (like making a copy of 
a word file, i.e., `essay_final_version3_for_real.docx`)

--
count: false

- A branch should be used for making 'one logical change', usually to add a 
feature in software development

--
count: false

- If a collaborator makes changes to master while you are working on a branch, 
you can pull in those changes

# Yeah, but... academic writing is different

.big[
- Using branches in many cases may be overkill, depending on what your working 
on, i.e., slides for class
]

--
count: false

<p></p>

.big[
- But there are concrete examples where it makes sense to use branches...
  - when collaborating with others
  - when working on large projects
  - when making revisions to a manuscript
  - when making changes to your website, cv, conference presentation/poster
  - whenever breaking something small will have a large impact on the project
  - whenever the possibility of "going back" needs to be controlled and 
  easily achieved

# Summary - workflows

### Old way

- Working solo: commit/push to master 

--
count: false
(.red[medium danger])

--
count: false
- Working as collaborator: commit/push to master 

--
count: false
(.red[danger]!)

--
count: false
- Working as outside collaborator: fork, commit/push to remote,  
pull request to master 

--
count: false
(.red[low danger])

--
count: false

background-size: 300px

### Better way

- Working solo: branch, commit/push, pull request
--
count: false
- Working as collaborator, branch, commit/push, pull request
--
count: false
- Working as outside collaborator: fork, branch, commit/push, pull request
