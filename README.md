Version control: A practical introduction to Git and GitHub
================

In this workshop we will learn to use Git and GitHub for version
control. Participants will develop an understanding for how version
control works on a coding/development platform.
No prior experience is needed. All resources were originally created
by Joseph Casillas, are freely available here:

and are re-used and altered slightly by Freya Watkins with permission

### Getting ready for the workshop

Please do the following **before** the workshop

1.  Install/Update R and RStudio to newest version available to you.
2.  Create a GitHub account at <https://github.com>
    -   It’s free
    -   Use an academic email if you have one (more perks)
    -   Give consideration to your username
        -   avoid spaces, uncommon characters
        -   shorter is better than longer
        -   usually your real name (or related to it)
3.  Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
4.  Install Git
    -   It is possible (likely) you already have it
    -   There are thorough instructions
        [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) explaining
        how to check and what to do if you don’t have it already

**Note**: If you have issues getting setup before the workshop, feel
free to email me at <f.watkins@pgr.bham.ac.uk> and I’ll do my best to
help get things running for you.
