Version control: A practical introduction to Git and GitHub
================

In this workshop we will learn to use Git and GitHub for version
control. Participants will develop an understanding for how version
control works on a coding/development platform and learn how to take
advantage of features like *issues* and *project boards* to complement
project centered workflows that facilitate collaboration and open
science practices. No prior experience is needed. All resources will be
freely available at <https://github.com/jvcasillas/rmd_workshop>
